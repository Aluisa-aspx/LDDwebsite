# lddwebsite
website for a project made with my friends on Discord connected to this website thing

# File path
I didn't use ROOTPATH on this project, so replace the start of those long directories with something like
`define('ROOT_PATH', realpath(dirname(__FILE__)));
include(ROOT_PATH . '/file_directory.php');`

# Disclaimer:

I pretty sure there's SQL vulnerabilities on this one too exclusively on the forum logins.

# Database set up:
I don't have the SQL commands for the databases, use IDs for every single one.
